## Motivation
We think this question is valuable to research as those who have limited financial means (such as students like us) would like to have the best quality accommodations for the lowest price that fits their budget. With the results of our analysis, we can form recommendations for this group regarding which European cities to visit, thereby better meeting the needs of this customer base and faciliating a more efficient search for listings when on the Airbnb site. 

## Data

AirBnB data used available at [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

Police data used available at [Data.Police](https://data.politie.nl/#/Politie/nl/dataset/47022NED/table?ts=1645109405238 ).


## Method and results

1. Introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contribtues to solving the research question/business problem.
2. Summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate. 

## Repository overview

1. Provide an overview of the directory structure and files. 
* data/ = stores the raw data. 
* data_output/ = stores the modified datasets. 
* documents/ = stores outlines, drafts, other text.
* fig_output/ = stores graphics from our data. 
* scripts/ = stores R scripts. 

## Running instructions

1. Explain the potential users how to run/replicate your worklfow. Touch upon, if necessary, the required input data, which (secret) credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (incl. links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.
